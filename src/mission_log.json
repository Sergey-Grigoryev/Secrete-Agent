Industry or sector (e.g., business, tourism, development)?\n2. Specific goals or objectives?\n3. Any relevant data or research already conducted?\n\nI can assist with finding the information you need and suggest tools and parameters for analysis if necessary.\n\nSome potential tools for determining a target country include:\n\n1. **Geospatial analysis software** like QGIS or ArcGIS, which could help in analyzing geographical and demographic data.\n2. **Market research tools** such as Google Trends or Keyword Planner (Google Ads) to gauge interest and demand for specific products or services.\n3. **Database of economic indicators**, like World Bank Open Data or the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals platform.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any other information I can help with."
